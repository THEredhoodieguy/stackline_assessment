**Stackline Assessment

Hey there! This is my attempt at the Stackline Assessment. Building a small webapp showing some sales data in both chart and table forms. Thanks for taking a look! üòÅ


** Visiting the page

You can visit the Github Pages hosted version of this app at https://theredhoodieguy.github.io/stackline_assessment/


** Trying it out locally

If you want to run the site locally, it's pretty simple:

1. Clone the repo. You can do this with `git clone https://github.com/THEredhoodieguy/stackline_assessment.git`

2. Install the depencies for the app. You'll need to be in the root folder of the repo to do this. Once there, run `npm i`

3. Run the app. This can be done from the repo root with `npm run dev`

4. View the app. Open a web browser to `localhost:5173` üéâ


** Dependencies

I added some NPM published libraries to build this app, here they are in no particular order:
* @emotion/react
* @emotion/styled
* @fontsource/roboto - fonts used by MUI
* @mui/material - MUI, a material UI component framework, mostly used for cards and to make styling a little easier
* @reduxjs/toolkit
* react
* react-dom
* react-redux
* @types/react
* @types/react-dom
* typescript
* vite - trying out vite instead of webpack for bundling
